# Forecasting Inflation in the United States
This is a repository containing the code for my Bachelor thesis in Economics (written in German).

I applied Statistical Learning techniques alongside established econometric models to forecast inflation in the United States 
using Real-Time-Data taken from the Philadelphia Fed's Research Database. 

The following *R* packages were used for the analysis. 

* dplyr 
* readr 
* readxl
* lubridate
* naniar
* quantmod
* tibble
* stringr
* purrr
* timetk 
* tsibble
* Metrics
* glmnet
* randomForest
* neuralnet
* gbm
* foreach
* doParallel
* ggplot2
* MCS
